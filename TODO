* Memory leaks
* Finding a place for the preface when some code (which will be removed) comes between needed assigns e.g.

    tmp1 = np.dot(j,k)
    m = rng.uniform(size=(c,d))
    y = np.dot(tmp1,m)

* Multiple visits to same code line
* Get rid of redundant arguments created by prepare_statement_with_internal_calls
* Branching: If, Try/Except
* Loops: For, While
* Comprehensions
* Combine adjacent guards

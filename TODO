* Internal call arguments that are not part of the optimizee - let them pass through.
* Allow additional outgoing edges from nodes_to_replace that are mere aliases of inputs to the optimized graph
* Finding a place for the preface when some code (which will be removed) comes between needed assigns e.g.

    tmp1 = np.dot(j,k)
    m = rng.uniform(size=(c,d))
    y = np.dot(tmp1,m)

* Get rid of redundant arguments created by prepare_statement_with_internal_calls
* Branching: If, Try/Except
* Loops: For, While
* multiple assign
* multiple statements on a line
* Comprehensions
* Combine adjacent guards



DONE: 
* Multiple visits to same code line
* Memory leaks -- (not done, but determined it's an astroid problem)
* Fix "fanout" for args that pass through an intfunccall (done - no more IntFuncCallNodes)
* Fix "stranded" nodes in dfg
